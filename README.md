## Release Details
Version 0.1
* Implementation of random response approach called 'Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response' in combination with Bloom Filter, memoization and simplified version.
* Implementation of hash based algorithms: Count Sketch and Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss.
* Implementation of random distribution based approaches.
* Implementation of a few component variation approaches.

## Next Steps
* Create a functionality that allows the type of algorithm and settings to be choosen as an input.
